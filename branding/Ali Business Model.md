## Content Strategy

Okay, let's analyze Ali's website and develop a trust-building content strategy based on the provided framework.

**1. MARKET ANALYSIS**

- **Trust Level Assessment:** Moderate. Ali's website is well-designed and professional, but in today's market, that's not enough to instantly build trust. The website has all the basics in place (information, programs, etc.) but it isn't clear that the content strategy is specifically designed to address trust gaps. There's no overt attempt to acknowledge the skepticism the audience may bring to the topic of health and wellness.
- **Market Sophistication Stage:** Stage 2 (Features & Benefits). Ali focuses on program benefits, but isn't yet diving deeply into her methods and unique value. She shares testimonials and outcomes, but needs to go deeper into why her process works and establish credibility beyond just good results. There's also not really enough focus on Ali's personal journey or lived experience yet to establish strong trust.
- **Audience Skepticism Level:** Likely High. Health and wellness is a saturated market with a lot of misinformation and questionable claims. The focus on perimenopause and insulin resistance addresses specific, common pain points, but these topics can be prone to fad-driven solutions. The target demographic (women in mid-life) are likely to be more skeptical due to past experiences and marketing fatigue.
- **Competition Analysis:** The wellness coaching space is very crowded. Many coaches use similar messaging and approaches. Ali needs a strategy that makes her stand out not just in what she offers, but in _how_ she connects with potential clients, establishes her trustworthiness and creates community.
